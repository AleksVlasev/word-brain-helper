I found the WordBrain game to be quite difficult at the upper levels and I felt like a lot of the game consisted of grunt checking of all possible words. This would be ok if once you found a word, it would accept it. However, a lot of sensible words are not accepted because of the nature of the puzzle. And that's okay. I wanted to make myself a little helped that would identify all the possible options. This worked but there turned out to be a ton of words, understandably, because the English language is full of weird words that we don't usually say. I remedied most of the problem by iterating and finding all possible solutions for a puzzle in the form a command line "game".

There are still a ton of options and sometimes the code is really slow for the larger puzzles. Some words are missing too. But on the whole, it works well to find solutions. Things left to do eventually

- add a GUI: working on this at the moment.
- sort the words by frequency in the English language so that more likely solutions would be found first. I'm not sure how to do this yet.
